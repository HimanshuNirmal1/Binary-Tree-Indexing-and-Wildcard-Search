Binary Tree Indexing and Wildcard Search

This lab consists of two major tasks:
• Building a binary tree to index the term dictionary and using it to answer single term queries
  and conjunctive queries
• Using a binary search tree to perform wildcard queries.


The Queue.java file is provided in case it is needed (for the wildcard search).
